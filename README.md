### Hi there 👋, I'm Manuel Solorzano 👨‍💻.

I'm a Senior Backend Engineer @ [Science](https://science.clinic/) - Sequoia-Backend *Healthcare* AI startup.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning <ins>internals</ins> of **distributed systems**, some of my notes are [here](https://github.com/eevmanu/pkb/blob/master/system_design/distributed-systems.md).
- 💬 Ask me about Python 🐍 and #remoteworking (been doing the latter for over 7 years).
- 📫 You can find me on [Twitter 🐦](https://twitter.com/eevmanu) or 📧 ‣ manuel ᵈºᵗ solorzanoc ªᵗ gmail ᵈºᵗ com.

**Topics I'm good at:**

Python 🐍 and containers 📦 (Docker & Kubernetes).

**Topics I'm improving:**

Check my [personal knowledge base 📖](https://github.com/eevmanu/pkb) if you're curious 👀 about how I practice **spaced repetition** over different topics.

I strongly recommend to use this learning technique, read more about it [here](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1441766163394990080).
